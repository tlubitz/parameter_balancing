# Parameter Balancing: Web2py Version

Parameter balancing is a tool for metabolic modelling in systems biology. It is implemented in Python3 and its code underlies the PEP8 guidelines. This subdirectory holds the files for the web2py application tool, which is also hosted online on www.parameterbalancing.net. If you want to run it on an own offline server, you will need to download a version of the web framework [web2py](http://www.web2py.com/). Then, you can directly download the parameter balancing application into the applications folder of your web2py server (web2py/applications/). For manipulating the code and user interface, you will require basic knowledge about the web2py web framework.
