    <h2><a href="main.html"><image width="100" src="/pb/static/images/pb-logo.png"></a>   Parameter Balancing for Kinetic Models of Cell Metabolism</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p style="width:700;">
      <b>What is parameter balancing?</b>
        <p style="width:700;">
	  Parameter balancing is a way to determine consistent parameter sets for kinetic models of metabolism.
	  Inserting experimentally measured values directly into a model will probably yield incomplete or
	  inconsistent parameter sets, violating the thermodynamic Haldane relationships. Balanced parameter
	  sets avoid this problem. They are computed based on kinetic constants and other data collected from
	  experiments or the literature, but also based on known constraints between biochemical quantities and
	  on assumptions about typical ranges, represented by prior values and bounds.
	</p>

    <p style="width:700;">
      <b>How can I run parameter balancing?</b>
        <p style="width:700;">
	  After preparing your model and data files, you can run parameter balancing interactively
	  <a href="../default/balancing.html">here</a>.
	  The workflow is described <a href="workflow.html">here</a>. If you prefer working
	  in the command line, or if you would like to include parameter balancing in your programs, you may use our code
	  <a href="software.html">for python and matlab</a>.
	</p>

    <p style="width:700;">
      <b>Which parameters of a metabolic model can be balanced?</b>
        <p style="width:700;">
	  In general, parameter balancing concerns the kinetic and thermodynamic constants in kinetic metabolic models.
	  It can also cover metabolite concentrations, chemical potentials, and reaction Gibbs free energies (or,
	  equivalently, "reaction affinities" or "driving forces"). Metabolic fluxes cannot be balanced, but they can
	  be included in the analysis (this is described below). There are different typical application cases:
	  <ul style="width:650;">
	    <li><b>Kinetic constants, where equilibrium constants are fixed and given</b></li>This can be done separately
	    for each individual reaction. If a network is large and equilibrium constants can be predefined (for instance,
	    by parameter balancing), we suggest to split the network into single reactions and to run parameter balancing
	    separately for every reaction.
	    <li><b>Kinetic constants and equilibrium constants in a network</b></li>
	    <li><b>Equilibrium constants and concentrations in a network</b></li>
	    <li><b>Equilibrium constants, kinetic constants, and concentrations in a network</b></li>
	  </ul>
	</p>

    <p style="width:700;">
      <b>What input data are needed?</b>
        <p style="width:700;">
	  Our program for parameter balancing uses SBML (Systems Biology Markup Language) files for model structures and
	  <a href="http://www.sbtab.net">SBtab table files</a> for parameter files. Parameter balancing imports a model (SBML)
	  and a table (SBtab) with measured parameter values, as well as a table with prior information. In our website, this
	  table is predefined and can be changed interactively. The program exports tables with balanced parameters (SBtab)
	  and, possibly, a model with rate laws and balanced parameters included (SBML). Please prepare your SBtab files as described in
	  <a href="file_format.html">here</a>. The validity of these files can be checked on
	  the <a href="http://www.sbtab.net">SBtab website</a>. The quantities described in your data
	  table will be linked to elements of the SBML model, via the entries in the columns SBMLReactionID and SBMLSpeciesID.
	  The IDs in these columns must match the IDs chosen in the SBML file.
	</p>

    <p style="width:700;">
      <b>Can I also use flux data?</b>
        <p style="width:700;">
	  Metabolic fluxes do not directly fit into the dependence scheme that parameter balancing uses internally to link
	  different quantitities. Therefore, fluxes cannot be used as input data, nor can they be predicted directly.
	  However, they can be used in an indirect way, as described in
	  <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0079195">Stanford et al. (2013)</a>.
	  The idea is as follows: In parameter balancing including metabolite levels and reaction Gibbs free energies, known
	  flux directions can be used to define the signs of all reaction Gibbs free energies. The resulting rate laws and
	  metabolite levels will be consistent with the predefined fluxes. The kinetic model, parametrised in this way, and
	  with the balanced metabolite levels, will yield reaction rates with the same signs as the predefined fluxes. By
	  rescaling the Vmax values (i.e., scaling the catalytic constants, enzyme levels, or both), reaction rates and fluxes
	  can be matched. The resulting model will correlate to the predefined flux distribution by construction. Note that, in order
	  for this to work, the predefined fluxes must be thermodynamically feasible (i.e., loop-free, and realisable for the
	  (potentially predefined) external metabolite levels.
	</p>

    <p style="width:700;">
      <b>Where can I find example files?</b>
        <p style="width:700;">
	  A number of example files (SBML models and SBtab data tables for parameter balancing) can be found
	  <a href="examples.html">here</a>.
	</p>

    <p style="width:700;">
      <b>Where can I find suitable input data for my own model?</b>
        <p style="width:700;">
	  Typical input data for estimating kinetic parameters comprise catalytic constants (kcat values), Michaelis-Menten
	  constants (KM values), equilibrium constants, standard reaction Gibbs free energies, and Gibbs free energies of formation.
	  Typical input data for estimating metabolic states also comprise metabolite concentrations.
	  <ul>
	    <li style="width:650;">A large collection of kinetic data is provided by the <a href="http://www.brenda-enzymes.org/">BRENDA
		Enzyme Database</a>.</li>
	    <li style="width:650;">Thermodynamic data for many reactions can be obtained from the website
	      <a href="http://equilibrator.weizmann.ac.il/">eQuilibrator</a>. This comprises calculated equilibrium constants and
	      standard reaction Gibbs free energies for different values of pH and ionic strength.</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>

    <p style="width:700;">
      <b>How can I define or modify the priors on model parameters?</b>
        <p style="width:700;">
	  Experimental data alone will usually not suffice to determine all model parameters. To determine underdetermined
	  parameters, and to keep parameters in realistic ranges, parameter balancing uses prior distributions and constraints
	  for each type of parameter. These priors and constraints are defined in a data table, which can be customised by the
	  user. The table is described <a href="quantities.html">here</a>.
	</p>

    <p style="width:700;">
      <b>Which kinetic rate laws are assumed in parameter balancing?</b>
        <p style="width:700;">
	  Parameter balancing is based on <a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/12/1528.abstract">modular
	  rate laws</a>, a generalised version of the convenience kinetics. The modular rate laws include reversible mass-action
	  and reversible Michaelis-Menten rate laws as special cases. Modular rate laws are also supported by
	  <a href="http://www.ra.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/software/SBMLsqueezer/">SBMLsqueezer</a>, which allows you to directly insert
	  rate laws into SBML models. In parameter balancing, rate laws and rate constants can be directly inserted into your model
	  at the end of the workflow. Note that all rate laws previously present in your model will be removed.
	</p>

    <p style="width:700;">
      <b>What physical units are used in parameter balancing?</b>
        <p style="width:700;">
	  The units are predefined in the <a href="quantities.html">prior table</a> and cannot be changed,
	  unless you provide your own customised prior table.
	</p>

    <p style="width:700;">
      <b>How does parameter balancing work mathematically?</b>
        <p style="width:700;">
	  Parameter balancing employs Bayesian estimation to determine a consistent set of all model parameters. To use it efficiently,
	  it is good to know about some of its details. For technical reasons, all quantities are internally converted to natural
	  scaling. This means that for energy quantities (in kJ/mol), we keep the original values while for all other quantities, we
	  take the natural logarithms. Furthermore, we distinguish between basic quantities and derived quantities (which are uniquely
	  determined by the basic quantities). See the <a href="quantities.html">overview of all quantities
	  considered</a>.
	</p>
        <p style="width:700;">
	  During balancing, we integrate information from data (values and standard errors), prior distributions (typical values and
	  spread for basic quantities), and pseudo values (typical values and spread for derived quantities). All these values and spreads
	  are represented by normal distributions (priors, data with standard errors, pseudo values, and posteriors) for the naturally
	  scaled quantities. When converting back to non-logarithmic values, we obtain log-normal distributions, which makes it crucial
	  to distinguish between median and mean values. Eventually, the median values (which are more realistic and guaranteed to satisfy
	  the relevant constraints) are inserted into the model.
	</p>

    <p style="width:700;">
      <b>Where is the method described?</b>
        <p style="width:700;">
	  Parameter balancing is described in <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp108764b">Lubitz et al. (2010)</a>. If you use
	  parameter balancing in your work, please refer to this article. A modelling workflow based on parameter balancing is described
	  in <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0079195">Stanford et al. (2013)</a>.
	</p>

    <p style="width:700;">
      <b>What are the known caveats?</b>
        <p style="width:700;">
	  Parameter balancing makes specific assumptions about the rate laws used. In some cases, this can lead to problems, or parameter
	  balancing may not be suitable for your modelling. Here we list points that can typically lead to problems:
	  <ul style="width:650;">
	    <li><b>Large models</b></li>Large networks lead to large parameter sets, which increase
	    the numerical effort of parameter balancing. One possibility to avoid this problem is to use fixed, precalculated equilibrium
	    constants. Then, the kinetic constants of each reaction can be balanced separately, which reduces the effort.
	    <li><b>Biomass reaction or polymerisation reactions</b></li>Many metabolic models (especially, models used in flux balance analysis)
	    contain a "biomass" reaction that involves a large number of compounds with largely varying stoichiometric coefficients.
	    Modular rate laws, as assumed in parameter balancing, use the stoichiometric coefficients as exponents in the formula. For
	    biomass reactions or polyerisation reactions, this is not very realistic as assumption. Furthermore, these reactions usually
	    do not have to be thermodynamically consistent. For both reasons, it is advisable to discard the automatically proposed kinetics,
	    and insert a more realistic kinetics instead (see, for instance, the rate laws proposed in
	    <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014579313005267">Hofmeyr et al., (2013))</a>.
	    <li><b>Very large or small parameter values</b></li>Very large or small parameter values can lead to unrealistic models and
	    numerical problems. Extreme values should be avoided by using proper bounds. In any case, we suggest to have a look at all
	    balanced values and to see if they are in realistic ranges.
	    <li><b>Large uncertainties and strongly shifted mean values</b></li>Each balanced parameter value comes with an uncertainty.
	    The uncertainties are described by normal distributions for the logarithmic parameter values, so median and mean value on
	    logarithmic scale will be identical. For the non-logarithmic values, we obtain a log-normal distribution, and median and mean
	    value will differ. If the uncertainty is large (which can easily happen if a value is not constrained by any data values), the
	    mean and median can become very different, and the mean value can become very high. This can be avoided by reducing the uncertainty
	    range - by providing more data that constraints the parameter value, by using narrower priors or constraints, or by using "pseudo"
	    values.
	    <li><b>What if the model cannot be simulated?</b></li>Problems in simulating the model (e.g., using COPASI) may be caused by
	    unrealistically high or low parameter values. If you notice such parameter values in your model and would like to avoid them, you
	    may use tighter priors or pseudo values to exclude extreme parameter values.
