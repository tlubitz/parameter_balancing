    <p style="width:900;">
      <b>What is parameter balancing?</b>
        </p><p style="width:900;">
	  Parameter balancing is a way to determine consistent parameter sets for kinetic models of metabolism.
	  Inserting experimentally measured values directly into a model will probably yield incomplete or
	  inconsistent parameter sets, violating the thermodynamic Haldane relationships. Balanced parameter
	  sets avoid this problem. They are computed based on kinetic constants and other data collected from
	  experiments or the literature, but also based on known constraints between biochemical quantities and
	  on assumptions about typical ranges, represented by prior values and bounds.
	</p>

      <b>How can I run parameter balancing?</b>
        <p style="width:900;">
	  After preparing your model and data files, you can run
	  parameter balancing interactively on this website.  If you
	  prefer working in the commandline, or if you would like to
	  include parameter balancing in your programs, you may check
	  out the various opportunities based on <a href="/pb/static/download.html">Python3 and Matlab code</a>.
	</p>

      <b>Which parameters of a metabolic model can be balanced?</b>
        <p style="width:900;">
	  In general, parameter balancing concerns the kinetic and thermodynamic constants in kinetic metabolic models.
	  It can also cover metabolite concentrations, chemical potentials, and reaction Gibbs free energies (or,
	  equivalently, "reaction affinities" or "driving forces"). Metabolic fluxes cannot be balanced, but they can
	  be included in the analysis (this is described below). There are different typical application cases:
	  </p><ul style="width:850;">
	    <li><b>Kinetic constants, where equilibrium constants are fixed and given</b></li>This can be done separately
	    for each individual reaction. If a network is large and equilibrium constants can be predefined (for instance,
	    by parameter balancing), we suggest to split the network into single reactions and to run parameter balancing
	    separately for every reaction.
	    <li><b>Kinetic constants and equilibrium constants in a network</b></li>
	    <li><b>Equilibrium constants and concentrations in a network</b></li>
	    <li><b>Equilibrium constants, kinetic constants, and concentrations in a network</b></li>
	  </ul>
	<p></p>

     <b>What input data are needed?</b>
        <p style="width:900;">
	  Parameter balancing employs SBML (Systems
          Biology Markup Language) files or <a href="http://www.sbtab.net/">SBtab files</a> for model structures and
	  SBtab table files for data and configuration files. Parameter balancing imports a model (SBML, obligatory) and a
          data table (SBtab, optional) with experimental data values. Furthermore, tables with information on the prior
	  distributions and balancing options are possible. Parameter balancing produces tables with balanced
          parameters (SBtab) and a model with rate laws and balanced parameters included (SBML). Please prepare your SBtab files as
          described below. The validity of these files can be checked on the <a href="http://www.sbtab.net/">SBtab website</a>. The quantities
          described in your data table will be linked to elements of the SBML model, via the entries in the columns !SBML:reaction:id and
          !SBML:species:id.  The IDs in these columns must match the IDs chosen in the SBML file.

    <div style="background-color:CDCCCB;width:900"><h2 id="wf">How to run parameter balancing online</h2></div>

    <p style="width:900;">Parameter balancing helps you find a consistent parameter set
      for a kinetic model, based on (i) kinetic constants and other data collected from
      experiments or the literature; (ii) constraints between biochemical quantities due
      to their definition or the laws of thermodynamics; (iii) assumptions about typical
      ranges, represented by prior distributions and pseudo values. As our standard rate
      laws, we use
      <a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/12/1528.abstract">modular
	rate laws</a>.
      </p><ol>
	<li style="width:880;"><b>Prepare your SBML model.</b> Please make sure that your SBML model is
	valid. You can use the official <a href="http://sbml.org/Facilities/Validator/">SBML online validator</a> for this.</li>
	<li style="width:880;"><b>Prepare your data file.</b> The
       SBtab Quantity table holds the kinetic parameters for the
       balancing.  Here again, make sure that the SBtab file is
       valid. You can use the
       official <a href="https://rumo.biologie.hu-berlin.de/SBtab/default/validator">SBtab
       online validator</a> for this. Please also keep in mind that
       the SBML species and reaction IDs need to comply with the IDs
       that are used in the SBtab file.</li>
        <li style="width:880;"><b>Prepare your parameter prior file
	  (optional).</b> This file holds information on the prior
	  distributions on the parameter types
	  (see <a href="http://www.parameterbalancing.net/pb/static/download.html">Download area</a>
	  for example files).  Initially, you can use the default
	  prior table which is already loaded. If you want to use an
	  alternative prior table, you can create your own prior table (keep in mind to adhere to
	  the syntax of the prior tables).</li>
        <li style="width:880;"><b>Prepare your options file (optional).</b> This file can be used to
	  change settings of the parameter balancing algorithm (see <a href="/pb/default/download.html">Download area</a>
          for example files).</li>
        <li style="width:880;"><b>Upload the files, run
          parameter balancing, and download the balanced parameters and model.</b>
          If the balancing process was successful, you can download
          the SBML file with the balanced parameters and convenience
          kinetics. Analogously, you can download
          the SBtab parameter file with the balanced parameters.</li>
      </ol>
    <p></p>

      <p style="width:900;"> Alternately, you provide all aforementioned information (model structure,
	experimental data, prior file, options file) in one single SBtab document, which consists
	of several SBtab tables. Mandatory for this option is an SBtab Reaction table, which can
	be translated to an SBMl model. Optional are
	SBtab Compartment, Parameter, and Compound tables, which are employed as additional model
	building information (see more information on the SBtab &lt;-&gt; SBML conversion on <a href="http://www.sbtab.net/">www.sbtab.net</a>).
	The three additional tables (for data, parameter priors, and settings) can also be included.

<p><strong>Remarks</strong>
</p><ol>
  <li style="width:860"><p>Note that the thermodynamic quantities refer to biochemical
      reactants (e.g.ATP) rather than chemical species
      (e.g. ATP<sup>4-</sup>). Therefore, they
      represent <em>transformed</em> quantities. In Alberty's exact notation,
      they  would be written as K' (for k<sup>eq</sup>),  μ' (for μ), and 
 μ'<sup>0</sup> (for  μ<sup>0</sup>).</p></li>  
  <li style="width:860"><p>
    In parameter balancing, all quantities representing energies (in
    kJ/mol) are treated in their original scale, while all other
    quantities are converted to logarithmic scale (column
    "Scaling"). Since the latter quantities are described by
    log-normal (instead of normal) distributions, we need to
    distinguish between their mean and median values. For more
    information on this topic, see the review
    <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167483894900450">Biochemical thermodynamics
      by R. Alberty</a>.
  </p></li>
  <li style="width:860">
    <p>We further distinguish between <em>basic</em> and
    <em>derived</em> quantities (column "Type"). The difference is
    that the basis quantities can be freely chosen (e.g., as a result
    of an estimation), while the derived quantities depend on the
    basic quantities and are computed from them. In parameter
    balancing, we define typical ranges for the basic quantities by
    <em>prior distributions</em> and for the derived quantities by
    <em>pseudo values</em>.
  </p></li>
  <li style="width:860">
    <p>When inserted into the SBML model, most quantities are inserted into
    kinetic rate laws as local parameters. Exceptions are concentrations
    (initial concentration attribute in species), standard chemical
    potentials (global parameters), and reaction affinities and chemical
    potentials, which could just be computed from other elements.
  </p></li>
  <li style="width:860;"><p>Some quantities depend on the specific definition of the reaction sum formula (nominal direction,
    appearance of small molecules like water); in particular for equilibrium constants, catalytic rate
    constants, and maximal velocities, make sure that the definitions match between model and data set.</p></li>
  <li style="width:860;"><p>Gibbs free energies can be used as proxies for the standard chemical potentials. However, make sure
    not to mix values from different data sets. It is possible that they will follow different conventions
    (setting the GFE for some large molecules to zero values for convenience) and will therefore be
    incompatible.</p></li>

    <div style="background-color:CDCCCB;width:900"><h2 id="faq">Frequently asked questions</h2></div>


      <b>Where is the parameter balancing method described?</b>
        <p style="width:900;">
	  Parameter balancing is described in <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp108764b">Lubitz et al. (2010)</a>.
          If you use
	  parameter balancing in your work, please refer to this article. A  modelling workflow based on parameter balancing is described
	  in <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0079195">Stanford et al. (2013)</a>.
	</p>

      <b>How does parameter balancing work mathematically?</b>
        <p style="width:900;">
	  Parameter balancing employs Bayesian estimation to determine
	  a consistent set of all model parameters. To use it
	  efficiently, it is good to know about some of its
	  details. For technical reasons, all quantities are
	  internally converted to natural scaling. This means that for
	  energy quantities (in kJ/mol), we keep the original values
	  while for all other quantities, we take the natural
	  logarithms. Furthermore, we distinguish between basic
	  quantities and derived quantities (which are uniquely
	  determined by the basic quantities). See
	  the overview of all quantities shown above. During balancing, we
	  integrate information from data (values and standard
	  errors), prior distributions (typical values and spread for
	  basic quantities), and pseudo values (typical values and
	  spread for derived quantities). All these values and spreads
	  are represented by normal distributions (priors, data with
	  standard errors, pseudo values, and posteriors) for the
	  naturally scaled quantities. When converting back to
	  non-logarithmic values, we obtain log-normal distributions,
	  which makes it crucial to distinguish between median and
	  mean values. Eventually, the median values (which are more
	  realistic and guaranteed to satisfy the relevant
	  constraints) are inserted into the model.
	</p>

      <b>Which kinetic rate laws are assumed in parameter balancing?</b>
        <p style="width:900;">
	  Parameter balancing is based on <a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/12/1528.abstract">modular
	  rate laws</a>, a generalised version of the convenience kinetics. The modular rate laws include reversible mass-action
	  and reversible Michaelis-Menten rate laws as special cases. Modular rate laws are also supported by
	  <a href="http://www.ra.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/software/SBMLsqueezer/">SBMLsqueezer</a>, which allows you to directly insert
	  rate laws into SBML models. In parameter balancing, rate laws and rate constants can be directly inserted into your model
	  at the end of the workflow. Note that all rate laws previously present in your model will be removed.
	</p>

    <p style="width:900;">
      <b>What files do I need to prepare?</b>
        </p><p style="width:900;">
	  A valid SBML file and a corresponding data file, provided in the SBtab format.
	</p>

      <b>Where can I find example files?</b>
        <p style="width:900;">
	  A number of example files (SBML models and SBtab data tables for parameter balancing) can be found
	  <a href="/pb/static/download.html">here</a>.
	</p>

      <b>What is the SBtab format?</b>
        <p style="width:900;">
	  SBtab tables can express various kinds of data. For the parameter balancing you need an
	  SBtab file of the type "Quantity". You can also edit the prior distribution for the
	  different parameter types by providing an SBtab file of the type "QuantityInfo". Finally,
	  you can configure several options for the parameter balancing process by providing an
	  SBtab file of the type "PbConfig". Examples for each of these SBtab files are on the
	  corresponding pages of the workflow and in the Downloads section. The current SBtab format is explained
	  <a href="http://www.sbtab.net/">here</a>. SBtab files are provided in the .tsv-format (tab
	  separated values).

      <b>What does a SBtab file look like?</b>
        <p style="width:900;">
	  In writing SBtab files, please regard the following facts:
	  </p><ol>
	    <li style="width:850;">The SBtab file begins with a specification line:
	      "!!SBtab TableType='QuantityType' Level='1' Version '0.1'". Please do not alter
	      this specification row, it will lead to trouble.</li>
	    <li style="width:850;">The next row holds the headers of the different columns.
	      Each header has to be started with an exclamation mark to be recognized as a header
	      name properly.</li>
	    <li style="width:850;">There are several mandatory column headers: !QuantityType,
	      !SBMLReactionID, ! SBMLSpeciesID, !Mean, !Std, !Unit</li>
	    <li style="width:850;">Please consider the following rules concerning the columns:
	  <ul>
	      <li style="width:820;">!QuantityType can only hold the specific names of parameter
		types. You can have a look at the QuantityTypes.tsv-file in the <a href="/pb/static/download.html">Download area</a> to see
		which those are. Watch spelling!</li>
	      <li style="width:820;">!SBML:reaction:id and !SBML:species:id hold the identifiers of the
		corresponding reaction and species. Watch out: they HAVE TO be the same identifier
		names like in the SBML file that is used. Watch spelling, too. No capital switches
		or anything.</li>
	      <li style="width:820;">!Mean: this column HAS TO hold a numeric value. If you do not
		have one, you do not need this row.</li>
	      <li style="width:820;">!Std: the standard deviation of the mean value. This can be
		left blank, if you have no std.</li>
	      <li style="width:820;">!Unit: please enter the unit of the mean value here.</li>
	      <li style="width:820;">Please note that different parameter types need either the
		!SBML:reaction:id (e.g. equilibrium constant), or the !SBML:species:id (e.g. concentration),
		or even both (e.g. Michaelis constant). If this is not entered correctly, the value
		will not be taken into account. Whether you need Reaction, Species, or both you can
		see in the default prior table.</li>
	      <li style="width:820;">To support consistent style, please stick to the presented order of the columns.</li>
	  </ul></li>
	  </ol>

      <b>Where can I find kinetic and other data for parameter balancing?</b>
        <p style="width:900;">
	  The parameter balancing relies on a posterior distribution of the different parameter
	  types and on a collection of kinetic data provided by the user. 
	  Typical input data for estimating kinetic parameters comprise catalytic constants (kcat values), Michaelis-Menten
	  constants (KM values), equilibrium constants, standard reaction Gibbs free energies, and Gibbs free energies of formation.
	  Typical input data for estimating metabolic states also comprise metabolite concentrations.
 Data obtained from experiments can be found in the 
literature and in  web resources:<p>
<ul>
	    <li style="width:850;">A large collection of kinetic data is provided by the <a href="http://www.brenda-enzymes.org/">BRENDA
		Enzyme Database</a>.</li>
	    <li style="width:850;">Thermodynamic data for many reactions can be obtained from the website
	      <a href="http://equilibrator.weizmann.ac.il/">eQuilibrator</a>. This comprises calculated equilibrium constants and
	      standard reaction Gibbs free energies for different values of pH and ionic strength. We provide a collection of
	      these data for parameter balancing <a href="http://www.parameterbalancing.net/pb/static/files/kegg_reactions_CC_ph7.0.tsv">here</a>.</li>
	  </ul>
	<p></p>


      <b>What physical units are used?</b>
        <p style="width:900;">
	  The units are predefined in the <a href="/pb/static/download.html">prior table</a> and cannot be changed,
	  unless you provide your own customised prior table.
	</p>

      <b>Can I also use flux data?</b>
        <p style="width:900;">
	  Metabolic fluxes do not directly fit into the dependence scheme that parameter balancing uses internally to link
	  different quantitities. Therefore, fluxes cannot be used as input data, nor can they be predicted directly.
	  However, they can be used in an indirect way, as described in
	  <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0079195">Stanford et al. (2013)</a>.
	  The idea is as follows: In parameter balancing including metabolite levels and reaction Gibbs free energies, known
	  flux directions can be used to define the signs of all reaction Gibbs free energies. The resulting rate laws and
	  metabolite levels will be consistent with the predefined fluxes. The kinetic model, parametrised in this way, and
	  with the balanced metabolite levels, will yield reaction rates with the same signs as the predefined fluxes. By
	  rescaling the Vmax values (i.e., scaling the catalytic constants, enzyme levels, or both), reaction rates and fluxes
	  can be matched. The resulting model will correlate to the predefined flux distribution by construction. Note that, in order
	  for this to work, the predefined fluxes must be thermodynamically feasible (i.e., loop-free, and realisable for the
	  (potentially predefined) external metabolite levels.
	</p>

      <b>How can I define or modify the priors on model parameters?</b>
        <p style="width:900;">
	  Experimental data alone will usually not suffice to determine all model parameters. To determine underdetermined
	  parameters, and to keep parameters in realistic ranges, parameter balancing uses prior distributions and constraints
	  for each type of parameter. These priors and constraints are defined in a data table, which can be customised by the
	  user. The table is described <a href="/pb/static/download.html">here</a>.
	</p>

      <b>What known caveats exist in parameter balancing?</b>
        <p style="width:900;">
	  Parameter balancing makes specific assumptions about the rate laws 
used. In some cases, this can lead to problems, or parameter
	  balancing may not be suitable for your modelling. Here we list points
 that can typically lead to problems:
	  </p><ul style="width:850;">
	    <li><b>Large models</b></li>Large networks lead to large parameter 
sets, which increase
	    the numerical effort of parameter balancing. One possibility to 
avoid this problem is to use fixed, precalculated equilibrium
	    constants. Then, the kinetic constants of each reaction can be 
balanced separately, which reduces the effort.
	    <li><b>Biomass reaction or polymerisation reactions</b></li>Many 
metabolic models (especially, models used in flux balance analysis)
	    contain a "biomass" reaction that involves a large number of 
compounds with largely varying stoichiometric coefficients.
	    Modular rate laws, as assumed in parameter balancing, use the 
stoichiometric coefficients as exponents in the formula. For
	    biomass reactions or polyerisation reactions, this is not very 
realistic as assumption. Furthermore, these reactions usually
	    do not have to be thermodynamically consistent. For both reasons, 
it is advisable to discard the automatically proposed kinetics,
	    and insert a more realistic kinetics instead (see, for instance, 
the rate laws proposed in
	    <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014579313005267">Hofmeyr et al., (2013))</a>.
	    <li><b>Very large or small parameter values</b></li>Very large or small parameter values can lead to unrealistic models and
	    numerical problems. Extreme values should be avoided by using proper bounds. In any case, we suggest to have a look at all
	    balanced values and to see if they are in realistic ranges.
	    <li><b>Large uncertainties and strongly shifted mean values</b></li>Each
 balanced parameter value comes with an uncertainty.
	    The uncertainties are described by normal distributions for the 
logarithmic parameter values, so median and mean value on
	    logarithmic scale will be identical. For the non-logarithmic 
values, we obtain a log-normal distribution, and median and mean
	    value will differ. If the uncertainty is large (which can easily 
happen if a value is not constrained by any data values), the
	    mean and median can become very different, and the mean value can 
become very high. This can be avoided by reducing the uncertainty
	    range - by providing more data that constraints the parameter 
value, by using narrower priors or constraints, or by using "pseudo"
	    values.
	    <li><b>What if the model cannot be simulated?</b></li>Problems in 
simulating the model (e.g., using COPASI) may be caused by
	    unrealistically high or low parameter values. If you notice such 
parameter values in your model and would like to avoid them, you
	    may use tighter priors or pseudo values to exclude extreme 
parameter values.
