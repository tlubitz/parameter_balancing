    <h2><a href="main.html"><image width="100" src="/pb/static/images/pb-logo.png"></a>   Parameter Balancing for Kinetic Models of Cell Metabolism</h2>

    <h3>The parameter balancing workflow</h3>

    <p style="width:700;">Parameter balancing helps you find a consistent parameter set
      for a kinetic model, based on (i) kinetic constants and other data collected from
      experiments or the literature; (ii) constraints between biochemical quantities due
      to their definition or the laws of thermodynamics; (iii) assumptions about typical
      ranges, represented by prior distributions and pseudo values. As our standard rate
      laws, we use
      <a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/12/1528.abstract">modular
	rate laws</a>.
      <ol>
	<li style="width:680;"><b>(1/4) Upload your SBML model.</b> Please make sure that your SBML model is
	valid. You can use the official <a href="http://sbml.org/Facilities/Validator/">SBML online validator</a> for this.</li>
	<li style="width:680;"><b>(2/4) Upload your SBtab file.</b> Here again, make sure that the SBtab file is
	  valid. You can use the official <a href="https://rumo.biologie.hu-berlin.de/SBtab/default/validator">SBtab online validator</a>
          for this. Please also keep in mind that the SBML species and reaction IDs need to comply with
          the IDs that are used in the SBtab file.</li>
        <li style="width:680;"><b>(3/4) Choose your prior file.</b> This file holds information on the prior distributions on the
	  parameter types. Initially, you can use the default prior table which is already loaded. If you want
	  to use an alternative prior table, you can choose one from the <a href="quantities.html">list</a> or
	  create your own prior table (keep in mind to adhere to the syntax of the prior tables).</li>
        <li style="width:680;"><b>(4/4) Download the balancing results.</b> If the balancing process was successful,
          you can download the SBML file with the balanced parameters and convenience kinetics from the SBML list.
	  Analogously, you can download the SBtab parameter file with the balanced parameters from the SBtab list.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p style="width:700;"> Alternately, you can also use the <i>Fast Lane Balancing</i> option:
      All required information are provided in one single SBtab document file, which consists
      of several SBtab tables. Mandatory for this option is an SBtab Reaction table, which can
      be translated to an SBMl model. Optional are
      SBtab Compartment, Parameter, and Compound tables, which are employed as additional model
      building information (see more information on the SBtab <-> SBML conversion on <a href="http://www.sbtab.net">www.sbtab.net</a>).
      Furthermore, the user can also provide an SBtab Quantity table,
      which holds the kinetic parameters for the balancing. Also, an SBtab QuantityInfo table
      can be part of this one SBtab document file, and it holds the information on the prior
      distributions for the balancing (see <a href="quantities.html">Quantities</a> for more
      information). Finally, an SBtab Config table can help you set configuration
      options for the balancing process (see <a href="../default/config.html">Configure Online Balancing</a>
      for more information).
