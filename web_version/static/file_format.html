    <h3>File format</h3>

    <p style="width:700;">Input files for parameter balancing must be prepared in the SBtab format.
      Some example files can be found <a href="examples.html">here</a>.
      <ol>
	<li>Data tables must be provided as tab-seperated text in a specific file format. The columns
	  QuantityType, SBMLReactionID, SBMLSpeciesID, and Mean (data value, arithmetic mean) are obligatory,
	  while the columns Std (data value, standard error), Unit, and other columns are optional.
	  Example files can be found <a href="examples.html">here</a>.</li>
	<li>Entries in the data table have to refer to species and reactions in the SBML file via the SBML
	  element identifiers ("id") given in the columns SBMLSpeciesID and SBMLReactionID.</li>
	<li>Please make sure that the modifiers (inhibitors or stimulators) in your model are identified
	  clearly by the corresponding SBO terms (inhibitor:20, stimulator:459). Otherwise, the software
	  will not recognize them, and the allosteric regulations will be ignored.</li>
	<li>The model reactions are assumed to refer to biochemical reactants (e.g. ATP) and not to individual
	  protonation states (like ATP4-). This means that the equilibrium constants or chemical potentials
	  considered in the model are in fact transformed thermodynamic quantities, which refer to the biochemical
	  reactants and will depend on the pH. This implies that protons (H+) may not appear in the reaction
	  formulas in the model and that the data used must also refer to transformed quantities. For more
	  information on this topic, see the review
	  <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167483894900450">Biochemical thermodynamics
	    by R. Alberty</a>.</li>
	<li>Some quantities depend on the specific definition of the reaction sum formula (nominal direction,
	  appearance of small molecules like water); in particular for equilibrium constants, catalytic rate
	  constants, and maximal velocities, make sure that the definitions match between model and data set.</li>
	<li>Gibbs free energies can be used as proxies for the standard chemical potentials. However, make sure
	  not to mix values from different data sets. It is possible that they will follow different conventions
	  (setting the GFE for some large molecules to zero values for convenience) and will therefore be
	  incompatible.</li>
