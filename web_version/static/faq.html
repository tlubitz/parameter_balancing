    <h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>

    <p style="width:700;">
      <b>What files do I need to prepare?</b>
        <p style="width:700;">
	  A valid SBML file and a corresponding parameter file, provided in the SBtab format.
	</p>

    <p style="width:700;">
      <b>What is the SBtab format?</b>
        <p style="width:700;">
	  SBtab tables can express various kinds of data. For the parameter balancing you need an
	  SBtab file of the type "Quantity". You can also edit the prior distribution for the
	  different parameter types by providing an SBtab file of the type "QuantityInfo". Finally,
	  you can configure several options for the parameter balancing process by providing an
	  SBtab file of the type "PbConfig". Examples for each of these SBtab files are on the
	  corresponding pages of the workflow and in the Downloads section. The current SBtab format is explained
	  <a href="http://www.sbtab.net">here</a>. SBtab files are provided in the .tsv-format (tab
	  separated values). 
	</p>

    <p style="width:700;">
      <b>Where can I acquire kinetic data for the parameter balancing?</b>
        <p style="width:700;">
	  The parameter balancing relies on a posterior distribution of the different parameter
	  types and on a collection of kinetic data provided by the user. These kinetic data are
	  ideally experimental data or data collected from web resources for this kind of information.
	  We recommend using the  <a href="http://www.brenda-enzymes.de/">Brenda website</a>
	  for the collection of kinetic data and the <a href="http://equilibrator.weizmann.ac.il/">eQuilibrator
	  website</a> for the provision of thermodynamic data.
	</p>

    <p style="width:700;">
      <b>What does a SBtab file look like?</b>
        <p style="width:700;">
	  In writing SBtab files, please regard the following facts:
	  <ol>
	    <li style="width:650;">The SBtab file begins with a specification line:
	      "!!SBtab TableType='QuantityType' Level='1' Version '0.1'". Please do not alter
	      this specification row, it will lead to trouble.</li>
	    <li style="width:650;">The next row holds the headers of the different columns.
	      Each header has to be started with an exclamation mark to be recognized as a header
	      name properly.</li>
	    <li style="width:650;">There are several mandatory column headers: !QuantityType,
	      !SBMLReactionID, ! SBMLSpeciesID, !Mean, !Std, !Unit</li>
	    <li style="width:650;">Please consider the following rules concerning the columns:
	  <ul>
	      <li style="width:620;">QuantityType can only hold the specific names of parameter
		types. You can have a look at the QuantityTypes.tsv-file in this directory to see
		which those are. Watch spelling!</li>
	      <li style="width:620;">SBMLReactionID and SBMLSpeciesID hold the identifiers of the
		corresponding reaction and species. Watch out: they HAVE TO be the same identifier
		names like in the SBML file that is used. Watch spelling, too. No capital switches
		or anything.</li>
	      <li style="width:620;">Mean: this column HAS TO hold a numeric value. If you don't
		have one, you don't need this row.</li>
	      <li style="width:620;">Std: the standard deviation of the mean value. This can be
		left blank, if you have no std.</li>
	      <li style="width:620;">Unit: please enter the unit of the mean value here.</li>
	      <li style="width:620;">Please note that different parameter types need either the
		SBMLReactionID (e.g. equilibrium constant), or the SBMLSpeciesID (e.g. concentration),
		or even both (e.g. Michaelis constant). If this is not entered correctly, the value
		will not be taken into account. Whether you need Reaction, Species, or both you can
		see in the QuantityTypes.tsv-file in this directory.</li>
	      <li style="width:620;">Please stick to the presented order of the columns. This is for
		sakes of consistency, but also the scripts might become problems (due to magical stuff
		in the programming code which is not sorted out yet. sorry!) with messed up column orders.</li>
	  </ul></li>
	  </ol>
	</p>

    <p style="width:700;">
      <b>I now have the files. How do I balance?</b>
        <p style="width:700;">
	  Go to semanticSBML.org and click the advanced user interface button (with the wheel). Then upload
	  an SBML model and click in the model list on the "Parameters" button. In the next window you can
	  upload your SBtab file in the .tsv format.

	  Next screen: you will see your uploaded SBtab file. If you hit the 'Options for collected data'
	  row below you can define, how missing standard deviations of your file will be handled. The default
	  factor for this is the given mean value times 0.5 (mean value = 10, standard deviation = 5). You
	  can also choose a cell volume, if you like.
	  Next screen: you will see a new SBtab file on the screen. This holds all values from your input
	  SBtab AND all values that will be aditionally generated for your SBML model after you hit the
	  "Submit Query" button.
	</p>

    <p style="width:700;">
      <b>How are these new parameter values generated?</b>
        <p style="width:700;">
	  To answer this question properly, you should read the underlying papers (Liebermeister,
	  et al., Bringing metabolic models to life, 2 papers). In short: the new values are "balanced",
	  this means, they are estimated within a Bayesian framework. The base of this estimation are
	  on the hand your input SBtab file (the more values you provide, the more accurate is the balancing),
	  and on the other hand a specific prior distribution for the different parameter types. These prior
	  distributions are set to default values and can be edited on the screen you are currently on (hit
	  'Edit prior distributions' row on the bottom of the screen).
	  HOW you edit these distributions has effect on the outcome of the balancing and very much depends
	  on your specific purposes. If you want to edit them, alter the two entry fields on the left and hit
	  the "--->" button to compute the new mean and std value.
	  The result of the Bayesian estimation will guarantee you a set of - and this is the most important
	  part - thermodynamically consistent parameter values for your model. According to the sensibility
	  of your input values, the output values might alter to different degrees in order to fulfill the
          thermodynamic constraints of the model (e.g. the Haldane relationship). Hit 'Submit Query' now and
	  go the next screen, the result screen.
	</p>

    <p style="width:700;">
      <b>I have the results now, what can I do with it?</b>
        <p style="width:700;">
	  On the one hand you can download the SBtab file (click the small 'Download parameter
	  table' button on the bottom of the SBtab) and store it on your hard drive for any purpose
	  possible. On the other hand you can insert the parameter values directly into your SBML
	  file in order to run simulations with it. You need to hit the 'Edit parameter insertion
	  options' row on the bottom of the screen.
	  Choose now the rate law (if you are unsure, use common modular rate law (CM) or read the
	  paper by Liebermeister et al., introducing the different rate laws). Choose the thermodynamic
	  parameterisation which defines, which parameter values will be entered into the SBML model.
	  Please make sure that the 'Overwrite existing kinetic laws' box is checked or the values
	  won't be entered if you already had kinetic laws assigned in the SBML code. Hit 'Submit Query'
	  and get back to the starting screen, where the finished SBML model awaits you.
